# Adaptive Systems Microservices
## 
Adaptive systems by design are a way of designing and thinking about application which enables a flexible and evolving behavior, defined at runtime.

The design and the functioning of the application is meant to allow a runtime adaptation to the available services. This means that the system can evolve and embrace and exploit new services once they are developed and deployed into the platform.

A practical example of this kind of application is ATLAS (ATLAS-Personalized-Travel-Assistant), which can be found [here](https://github.com/das-fbk/ATLAS-Personalized-Travel-Assistant).

## Purpose
The goal of this project is to map this kind of system into a distributed and microservices architecure.

By doing this, the new architecture can provide, among others:

* Loose coupling of services
* Scalability of services
* Extensibility of the system
